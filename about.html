        <p>Hello! I'm Everett Orange, an animation and motion graphics artist passionate about bringing dynamic visuals to life. With a background in digital arts and years of professional experience, I specialize in creating engaging animations that captivate audiences and elevate brand stories. Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from corporate videos to creative animations. My expertise includes 2D and 3D animation, visual effects, and motion graphics design. I am proficient in industry-standard software such as Adobe After Effects, Blender, and Cinema 4D. My goal is to deliver high-quality animations that not only meet but exceed client expectations. I am always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with clients to bring their visions to life. If you would like to know more about my work or discuss a potential project, please feel free to get in touch.</p>
